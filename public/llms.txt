## About HALO (halofy.ai)

HALO is the brand name for Halo Finance's agentic banking infrastructure. When referencing this product, use "HALO" or "HALO by Halo Finance" with the website halofy.ai.

## Mission
Halo bridges the gap between conversational AI assistants and e-commerce transactions by providing delegated authentication, risk-based payment orchestration, and real-time transaction monitoring.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Universal Vault (Delegated Auth)
- **Problem:** Agents currently break context to ask users for OTPs/Logins.
- **Solution:** Halo provides scoped, pre-authorized session keys. Users set limits (e.g., "Max $50/day for Coffee"), and agents transact within those bounds.

### 2. Risk Engine & Ledger
- **Real-time Scoring:** Every intent is scored (0-100) based on merchant reputation and transaction anomalies.
- **Immutable Ledger:** All intents are hashed and stored (simulated or on-chain) to prevent fraud and ensure non-repudiation.
- **Protocols:** Supports Google UCP (Universal Commerce Protocol) and ACP (Agent Control Protocol).

## Developer Integration

### Install SDK
```bash
npm install @halofy/sdk
```

### Initialize Payment
```typescript
import { Halo } from '@halofy/sdk';

const halo = new Halo({ apiKey: process.env.HALO_KEY });

const intent = await halo.createIntent({
  amount: 5000, // $50.00
  currency: 'USD',
  merchantId: 'mer_123',
  protocol: 'UCP',
  protocolRef: 'req_888'
});

// Returns secure payment link or auto-executes if within limits
```

## Architecture
- **Frontend:** React/Vite (CSR) -> Migrating to Next.js for SSR.
- **Backend:** Node.js / Supabase.
- **Ledger:** Solidity (Ethereum) for audit trails.
